# Wasmer will let you easily run WebAssembly module in a Python host.
#
# This example illustrates the basics of using Wasmer through a “Hello
# World”-like project:
#
#   1. How to load a WebAssembly module as bytes,
#   2. How to compile the module,
#   3. How to create an instance of the module.
#
# You can run the example directly by executing in Wasmer root:
#
# ```shell
# $ python examples/instance.py
# ```
#
# Ready?

# Let's instantiate the module!

# We now have an instance ready to be used.
#
# From an `Instance` we can retrieve any exported entities. Each of
# these entities is covered in others examples.
#
# Here we are retrieving the exported function. We won't go into
# details here as the main focus of this example is to show how to
# create an instance out of a Wasm module and have basic interactions
# with it.
